Title:

        Example : Curent Date when the Status was creasdte and  from next line 
                  the content was save
          eg:Date: 03-03-2025 Time : 13:40  (curent date and time when Status it was created and time format just like this )
             Status : Toady i have did.......... etc
          simiantinously as i add another data on the Status column
Prject Activity : Active/Deactive (by dfalut Active)
Hours Aloweded : " " (as Total hour can be aded by the authrized role)
Working Online Hour:: it also structure like  Status example
             Date:03-03-2025 Time: 14:02  (curent date and time when Status it was created and time format just like this ) 
             and from the next line
             8 (as per the the coming value eg: 8 or 5) we can acdd many as per requirement
Working Offlin Hour:: iit also structure like  Status example
             Date:03-03-2025 Time: 14:02  (curent date and time when Status it was created and time format just like this ) 
             and from the next line
             8 (as per the the coming value eg: 8 or 5) we can add many as per requirement

as time we add hours to the Workng Online Hour and Working Offline Hour in the column the amount was deducted from the Hours Alowed
eg if we have Hours Aloweded : 80
and we added working Online Hour :  Date:03-03-2025 Time: 14:02 
                                   8 Hour
and we added Working Offline Hour :  Date:03-03-2025 Time: 14:02 
                                   1 Hour

then we have total 9 hour that we get from  Online Hour and Offlin Hour
now so auto minus these from the Hours Aloweded
like 80-9 = 71
Now undated walus is 
and then fiinal update taht output to the 
Hours Aloweded : 71


             
Total Worked Hours: now in the Total worked hout in this all the hous of Offline and Online add tel and then add to th Total Wored Hour
             AS example when we addd 8 and 1 then it would be 8 +1 =9
          so Tital Worked Hour : 9
